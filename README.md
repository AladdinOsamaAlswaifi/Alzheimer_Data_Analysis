### **Health Disparities Analysis: Exploring Arthritis Trends**

#### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the prevalence and trends of arthritis among different demographic groups using a large-scale health dataset. The analysis aims to uncover disparities in arthritis rates across various regions, ethnicities, age groups, and potentially other demographic factors.

#### **Key Objectives**
- **Trend Analysis**: Investigated the overall trends in arthritis prevalence over time, highlighting significant increases and decreases in reported cases.
- **Regional Comparison**: Comparing arthritis trends across different geographical regions, identifying regions with higher or lower prevalence, and analyzing potential causes.
- **Demographic Impact**:
  - **Age**: Explored how age influences arthritis prevalence, showing a clear correlation between older age groups and higher arthritis rates.
  - **Ethnicity**: Analyzed the impact of ethnicity on arthritis trends, revealing disparities among different ethnic groups, with some groups showing significantly higher prevalence.
  - **Gender & Income (Potential Analysis)**: Although the dataset lacked explicit gender and income data, the project outlined possible approaches for analyzing these factors using additional data sources.

#### **Tools and Techniques**
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Processed and cleaned the dataset, handling missing data, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Used Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to create detailed visualizations that highlight trends and disparities across different demographic groups.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand underlying patterns and correlations between different variables.

#### **Insights and Conclusions**
The project highlighted significant disparities in arthritis prevalence across different regions and demographic groups. The analysis provided valuable insights into how factors such as age and ethnicity influence arthritis trends, offering a foundation for more targeted public health interventions.

#### **Future Work**
To further enrich the analysis, future work could involve integrating additional data sources to explore the impact of income levels, education, and gender on arthritis prevalence. Additionally, more advanced statistical methods could be applied to quantify the significance of observed trends and disparities.
